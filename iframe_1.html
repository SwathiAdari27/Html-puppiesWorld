<p> A <strong>puppy</strong> is a <i>juvenile dog</i>.Some puppies can weigh 1-1.5,while
larger ones can weigh up to 7-11kg.All healthy puppies grow quikly after birth.A puppy's coat
color may change as the puppy grows older,as is commonly seen in breeds such as <b>Yorkshire
Terrier.</b> </p>

<p>Born after an average of 63 days of <i>gestation</i>, puppies emerge in an <i>amnion</i>
that is bitten off and eaten by the mother dog.Puppies begin to <i>nurse</i> almost immediately.
If the litter exceeds six puppies, particularly if one or more are obvious <i>runts</i>, human
intervention in hand-feeding the stronger puppies is necessary to ensure that the runts get
proper nourishment and attention from the mother.The mother may regurgitate partially digested
food for the puppies or might let them eat some of her solid food.The mother dog usually
refuses to nurse at this stage, though she might let them occasionally nurse for comfort.</p>

<p><strong>Puppies</strong> are highly social animals and spend most of their waking hours
interacting with either their mother or littermates. When puppies are socialized with humans,
particularly between the ages of eight and twelve weeks, they develop social skills around
people.</p>
